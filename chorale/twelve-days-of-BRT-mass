"The Twelve Days of BRT-mass"

See busnotes[1] for details if you do not speak Transit. On that note,
"burtmass" might profitably be substituted by "transit" if presenting to
a lay audience.

On the first day of burtmass, my city gave to me
... a lack of signal priority

[Chorus pauses for some time, "oh, come on!", etc. (Avant-garde
productions would doubtless insert Cage's 4'33" here.) If performing in
public, wait for a nearby light to change.]

Busnotes

[1]  Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) which often just means busses stuck
     in traffic as usual but with fancy paint jobs (see day eight)
     plus countless billions spent on building and maintaining the
     open air sewer that is the road network.
[2]  Bus bulbs help avoid the lol-bus-stuck-trying-to-merge-into-traffic
     situation. However, they're more expensive than just sticking a
     metro sign in a puddle of water or some bushes or the like, and
     tend to cause frothy-mouthed rage from car drivers thus stuck
     behind the stopped bus.
[3]  Mercer and something in downtown Seattle, legendary for a four-
     something minute traffic light and the resulting somehow less-than-
     rapid bus rides.
[4]  There's a rapid ride to Ballard that is currently a) not faster
     than the express it replaced and b) painted red. Vroom, vroom!
[5]  Seattle rapid ride busses, as of December 2012, have no
     published schedule, on account of the busses being "so frequent
     one does not need a schedule." Two lies in a mere eight words,
     and promise of more.
[6]  A regressive sales tax to bootâ€”because there's nothing like
     kicking the poor while they're down.
[7]  Local roads, besides some Bridging the Gap tax increases here
     and there, having not really seen any significant repair since
     1994 or so.
[8]  Technology is the hard.


Footnotes

Car free in Seattle since 1994. Maybe I'll learn to drive one of these
years. Signs point to no, though.
