Busnotes

[1]  Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) which often just means busses stuck in
     traffic as usual but with fancy paint jobs and other gimmicks (see
     day eight).
[2]  Bus bulbs help avoid the lol-bus-stuck-trying-to-merge-into-traffic
     situation. However, they're more expensive than just sticking a
     metro sign in a puddle of water or some bushes or the like, and
     tend to cause frothy-mouthed rage from car drivers[10] thus stuck
     behind the stopped bus.
[3]  Mercer and something in downtown Seattle, legendary for a
     4m30s traffic light and the resulting obviously less-than-
     rapid bus rides.
[4]  RCW 46.61.220, often observed more in spirit than practice. If only
     there were some way to grade separate things. But that's expensive!
     Stuck in cars it is...
[5]  There's a rapid ride to Ballard that is currently a) not faster
     than the express it replaced and b) red. So it's fast, right?
[6]  Milk runs are bus lines that meander all about the city, providing
     rides between nowhere and nowhere, slowly, and not very often. This
     means it will take hours to get anywhere, and heaven help you if
     you have to make a transfer. (Somehow, America manages to burn
     through the Lion's Share of oil on the planet. Somehow.)
[7]  Seattle rapid ride busses, as of December 2012, have no
     published schedule, on account of the busses being "so frequent
     one does not need a schedule." Two lies in a mere eight words,
     and promise of more.
[8]  Of course, transit bloggers foam at the mouth due to everything
     on this list, but hey, that's American can't-do car-based
     complacency for you.
[9]  The 12 minutes actually being in hexadecimal (or worse).
[10] See for example the comment section of any car-leaning (check where
     their ad revenue comes from) news publication.


Footnote

Car free in Seattle since 1994. Maybe I'll learn to drive one of these
years. Signs point to no, though.
