CORPORATE COMPOSITION

Copyright © 2013 by Jeremy Mates
All rights reserved.

   A short play ruminating on interrupt-driven, meeting-infested
   corporations, all the wonders of technological progress, and how a
   team of composers might perform putting together a Symphony. Direct
   inspiration probably from reading “Quiet” by Susan Cain. Amusingly, a
   coffee shop a few days later featured a group of people being not
   very productive discussing Drop Box, whether files were shared or
   not, troubles deleting files, and so forth, and in general not making
   any progress on whatever it was they were working on.

SCENE:
A meeting room. Ideally small; a table or tables dominate the center,
with an excess of chairs around edges. The walls are covered with
whiteboards possessing varying degrees of random scribbles and workflows
including both "DNE" markings and "please clean whiteboard" prints. The
exit should be a sliding door, with noisy rollers, left partially ajar,
that leads to a hallway invisible to the audience. Fluorescent lighting
is recommended. A speakerphone system is required for COMPOSER 2; this
should have poor audio quality (breathing on the mic, etc), and should
be set slightly loud relative the on-stage actors.

[COMPOSERS 1 & 4 are in sotto voce conversation with one another,
  COMPOSER 3 is set somewhat apart]

MANAGER.    Right. Let's get started. We're working on the symphony today.
COMPOSERS 1 & 4. Okay.
COMPOSER 2. Could you move closer to the mic? I can barely hear you.
MANAGER.    [fiddles with speakerphone] That better?
COMPOSER 2. Perfect.
MANAGER.    So, the symphony. Last meeting we had finished the opening
  phrase, does everyone have that?
COMPOSER 1. Yup.
COMPOSER 2. Was it e-mailed?
COMPOSER 4. It's on the wiki.
COMPOSER 2. Okay, thanks.
MANAGER.    Everyone have it open? Okay, so this meeting we'll work on the
  second phrase.
2ND VIOLIN. [leans through door] Uhh, hey, is this the quartet?
MANAGER.    No, they're in 1123.
2ND VIOLIN. Sorry guys, thanks.
[Exits, closing door]
MANAGER.    … so we'll work on the second phrase—yes?
COMPOSER 1. I think we need to fix the instrumentation.
MANAGER.    Didn't we cover that last meeting?
COMPOSER 1. Yes, but I'm not convinced we need the horns, and not having
  them changes the second phrase.
COMPOSER 4. We never really did finish the instrumentation.
MANAGER.    I thought we did.
COMPOSER 4. No, we ran out of time.
MANAGER.    Okay, so what's wrong with the horns?
COMPOSER 1. It's too early for them, I think a softer start would be
  better. Did you get the sample I sent you?
MANAGER.    Let me see… [swipes away at some device] when did you send it?
COMPOSER 1. Tuesday.
MANAGER.    I don't see it.
COMPOSER 4. Check the spam folder.
[More device swiping]
MANAGER.    How did it get in there?
COMPOSER 1. Am I in your address book?
MANAGER.    You should be.
COMPOSER 1. I used my gmail address.
MANAGER.    [checks something] Oh, I had your old account. Let me add
  you again.
[Pause]
COMPOSER 1. So, if you listen to that sample, you'll hear that the horns
  are a problem.
COMPOSER 4. Wasn't four voices one of our requirements?
COMPOSER 1. Sure, but my idea is we split the violins, have them cover
  the horn part.
COMPOSER 2. Uhh, guys?
MANAGER.    [leans over speakerphone] Go ahead.
COMPOSER 2. The horns are much louder than the violins. I don't think
  half the violins will work.
COMPOSER 1. That's why we use a softer opening.
COMPOSER 2. Did you see my plan?
COMPOSER 4. The one with parallel motion?
COMPOSER 2. I think it's fine, the basses are just doubling—
COMPOSER 4. No, no, I saw your version. It has a parallel fifth.
COMPOSER 2. What? Where?
COMPOSER 4. In measure three.
COMPOSER 2. [pause] Ahh, oh, I see it now. Sorry guys.
MANAGER.    Okay, so we drop the horns from the opening, violins one and
  two keep us at four voices. Any objections? No? Who is going to own
  this change?
COMPOSER 2. I can, I’m in the wiki.
[Mic is left open]
MANAGER.    Perfect! All right, second phrase. I want ideas from everybody
  this time.
COMPOSER 1. I think we should just repeat the first phrase.
COMPOSER 4. How about we repeat with the horns?
COMPOSER 1. No, too soon. Eventually we add the horns in on top.
COMPOSER 4. A slow build-up?
COMPOSER 1. Exactly.
MANAGER.    Good, good—any other ideas?
COMPOSER 1. We need more dominants.
MANAGER.    What about them?
[Background noise from the open mic on the speakerphone grows]
COMPOSER 4. Hey, open mic.
COMPOSER 2. Sorry. [mutes line]
1ST VIOLIN. [barging in] Do you guys have this room?
MANAGER.    Yes, it's ours.
1ST VIOLIN. Really?
MANAGER.    Aren't you in 1123?
1ST VIOLIN. The calendar was free when I scheduled this room.
MANAGER.    What happened to 1123?
1ST VIOLIN. The conductors kicked us out.
MANAGER.    Well, we have this room.
2ND VIOLIN. [leaning in] Maybe we could try the roof?
1ST VIOLIN. That's crazy.
2ND VIOLIN. But there's nobody up there.
MANAGER.    Sorry, we have this room.
1ST VIOLIN. Okay.
[Violinists retreat, closing door]
MANAGER.    You were saying something about…?
COMPOSER 4. Dominants.
COMPOSER 1. Yeah, we need more of them.
COMPOSER 4. Just regular dominants?
COMPOSER 1. No, variations on them—inversions, sevenths, and all that.
MANAGER.    Would that make things interesting?
COMPOSER 4. Yeah, yeah! We could even shift them to augmented sixths!
COMPOSER 3. Bruckner did that in his seventh symphony.
COMPOSER 4. He did?
COMPOSER 3. Second movement, starting around measure 80.
[Everyone stares at COMPOSER 3]
MANAGER.    Well, we're working on our first movement, not the second.
[Quartet strikes up something rousing offstage, for example…]

MANAGER.    [opens and leans out door] Hey, hey! Could you guys practice
  somewhere else?
1ST VIOLIN. [offstage] But it's raining out there!
MANAGER.    You can't practice here. Okay?
[Muttering and banging from offstage; manager closes door]
MANAGER.    Where were we?
COMPOSER 2. We were talking about dominants.
MANAGER.    Dominants, right. Who is going to work on those?
COMPOSER 1. They're my idea.
COMPOSER 4. I think I can come up with some, too.
MANAGER.    Good, I want to hear ideas from all of you. How long will that
  take you guys?
COMPOSER 1. A day or two, I suppose.
MANAGER.    Can you be specific? I need hours for the project plan.
COMPOSER 4. Twelve hours for me, but I'm going to the retreat tomorrow.
COMPOSER 1. Yeah, make it twelve hours.
MANAGER.    [pokes at device] Day and a half, plus a day for the
  teambuilding. Okay. So, the second phrase. We repeat it?
COMPOSER 1. Well, not exactly, if we're altering the dominants.
MANAGER.    But provisionally we just repeat it?
COMPOSER 4. Sure.
COMPOSER 1. And we need to work out the dynamics.
MANAGER.    Can't we do those afterwards?
COMPOSER 1. Well, we need to work the dynamics towards the horn intro.
MANAGER.    Where does that happen?
COMPOSER 1. In the third, maybe fourth phrase?
COMPOSER 4. How about cutting them into the second phrase? With one of
  the new dominants?
MANAGER.    Will that work?
COMPOSER 1. I don't think so, it'll be too abrupt.
COMPOSER 4. No, I think it can work out.
MANAGER.    Okay, okay. So we'll work on the horn intro in our next
  meeting. How about your early idea?
COMPOSER 4. Well, that depends on the dominants. I'll have to experiment.
MANAGER.    Is that part of the dominant testing?
COMPOSER 4. Sure.
[Pause while manager fiddles with device]
MANAGER.    Okay, so next meeting: second phrase dominants versus just
  copying the first phrase, horn intro ideas, and if we have time, the
  third phrase. I'll send the updated project plan to the group right—
COMPOSER 1. No, don't do that, groups are broken.
MANAGER.    What?
COMPOSER 4. Yeah, if you send it to the group, nobody can see the document.
MANAGER.    Did someone report this?
COMPOSER 1. A while ago, I think fixing it is in their next release
  cycle. Groups are still pretty new.
COMPOSER 4. You have to e-mail everyone with the document so they
  can see it. Using groups is fine for permissions, just not for
  sharing things.
MANAGER.    All right, I'll send individual e-mails.
[A long pause while the manager does this]
MANAGER.    Make sure you all acknowledge the e-mail, I need to see that
  you got it.
COMPOSERS.  [murmurs of assent]
MANAGER.    Okay, I think we have time to cover dynamics. What do we have?
COMPOSER 1. Well, the opening is piano.
MANAGER.    Great!
COMPOSER 2. Uhh, guys, guys, the wiki says pianissimo.
COMPOSER 4. Did you change something?
COMPOSER 2. No, it's pp, and then a poco crescendo I guess? Kinda hard
  to read this font.
COMPOSER 1. Check the edit history. Someone must have changed it.
COMPOSER 2. Where is that?
COMPOSER 1. Top right, under the review icon and then change log and
  then the revisions tab.
COMPOSER 2. Which one is the review icon? It used to say "review."
COMPOSER 4. It's the gear with the little triangle.
COMPOSER 1. They changed it when they redid the U.I.
COMPOSER 2. Ahh, okay. [pause] Found it. [mumbles while clicking] change
  log…and then revisions…
[Longer pause, perhaps scrolling sounds]
COMPOSER 2. It says the host TAO edited it.
COMPOSER 1. No username?
COMPOSER 2. No, just TAO, there's also an IP address, one ninety two dot
  zero dot two—
COMPOSER 1. That's fine. Whose host is TAO?
[Silence and stares]
MANAGER.    Oh, that's my laptop. I must have changed p to pp by accident,
  sorry about that.
COMPOSER 2. So should I change it back?
COMPOSER 1. Yes. We need piano to open.
COMPOSER 2. and the crescendo?
COMPOSER 1. That's fine, piano to poco crescendo.
COMPOSER 4. Then do we decrescendo?
COMPOSER 1. No, I think we should hold to the rest.
COMPOSER 4. A rest? Doesn't it cut directly to the second phrase?
COMPOSER 1. No, the rests aren't shown in the draft version. They only
  get rendered when you do a full build.
COMPOSER 4. Oh, I see. [tilts device and stares] So there's…ah, a
  quarter rest?
COMPOSER 1. Yeah.
COMPOSER 4. Okay, in that case, I think we should hold the dynamic to that.
MANAGER.    This is great work, guys. So we all agree on the dynamics—piano
  to crescendo, and hold that to the next phrase?
COMPOSER 1. To the rest.
MANAGER.    Right, that's what I said.
[Speakerphone doo-deeps]
MANAGER.    Hi, who just joined?
COMPOSER 2. Sorry guys, I got disconnected. What did I miss?
MANAGER.    No problem, we were talking about holding the dynamic to
  the rest.
COMPOSER 2. What rest?
[Cut lights & curtains]
