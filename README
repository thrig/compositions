Mostly just practice pieces. In particular:

 * 29 - short elegy for orchestra or possibly other renditions.
 * dmm - musical doodle via markov chains based on the relative
   lengths of piano keys in a particular artwork. (fanfare1 is also
   markov based)
 * etudes - experiments with enharmonics and some of the Perl
   modules I've created for musical composition.
 * inventions - two voice experiments.
 * menuetish - various "menuets" but some probably aren't.
 * modulus - results modulus math.

Not everything here called a minuet is probably a minuet, but I'm
learning as I go, so...
