A "hemitonic pentatonic scale" A-B-C-E-F is used in this piece; for more
information on these handy scales, see:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentatonic

The modulus math was fiddled with to produce a pleasing bass line (much
repetition, good pairing with the other bass line), while the upper
lines are allowed more freedom. The "random" walks up and down by the
upper lines are a happy accident of LilyPond notation relativism.

Inspired from http://www.perl.com/pub/2004/08/31/livecode.html and a
totally coincidental discussion of pentatonic scales on #music-theory
on freenode.


Instructions on Modifying the Music

* Run the *.pl scripts. Requires Perl, or port the code to anything
  that can perform modulus math and convert those numbers to a
  LilyPond symbol.
* Paste the output into the *.ly file. Fiddle with instruments,
  voices, etc.
* Build the music via LilyPond, for example `make modulus.pdf` if GNU
  make is available.
* I use timidity for MIDI playback; it has a much nicer sound set
  available than for the Mac OS X default, though the initial setup can
  be troublesome (e.g. finding the random sound files, installation,
  configuration). The sound sets can have a huge influence on which
  instruments work for the piece.
* Fiddle with the modulus math, what notes are generated, instruments
  until you get something good going.

Yes, the *.ly file could probably be a template, and auto-generated by a
Makefile rule, but I'm too lazy to set that up.
