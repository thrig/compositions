Mostly just practice pieces. In particular:

 * 29 - short elegy for orchestra or possibly other renditions.
 * dmm - musical doodle via markov chains based on the relative lengths
   of piano keys in a particular doodle.
 * etude1, etude2 - experiments with enharmonics and some of the Perl
   modules I've created for musical composition.

Rendered versions of some of the music here may be available under:

Not everything here called a minuet is probably a minuet, but I'm
learning as I go, so...
