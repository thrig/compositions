% This script tries to make MIDI output from LilyPond a little more realistic.
% It tries to take articulations (slurs, staccato) into account, by 
% replacing notes  with sequential music of suitably time-scaled note plus 
% skip.
%
% It also tries to unfold trills turns etc., and take rallentendo 
% and accelerando into account.
%
% As my scheme knowledge is poor (I was teaching myself as I went), there 
% is much scope for improvement.

%
%%%USAGE
% In the \score section do:
%  \unfoldRepeats \articulate <<
%	all the rest of the score
% >>
% or use the lilywrap script.
%
% TO DO (prioritised, the ones that'll make the most difference first)
%
% * Dynamics.  
%   * Fix quantisation for dynamics on single note (replace note 
%     with tied 128th notes?) -- started, needs work.
%   * Make \fp do the right thing (loud start, then quiet).
%
% * Inegalite.  Notes on-beat steal time from notes off-beat.  
%   Degree of stealing is a parameter: from 1.0 (straight) 
%   to 1.5 (extreme swing).  Also fix tenuto to use this.
%
% * add accel (to match rall), and molto rall. I've never seen 
%   molto accel but some composer somewhere has probably used it.
%
% * Fermata, and Fermata Lunga
% * Add more synonyms for accel and rall: rit ritard stringendo 
%
% * Phrasing.
%   * Rall at end of piece
%   * Very slight accel into a phrase, rall out of it.
%   * Dynamics during a phrase????  unclear how these should be in 
%     the general case
%
% * Trill algorithm needs work.
%
% * Cope with more ornaments/articulations.
%    mordents, inverted-turns, etc.
%   -- accent needs better control of dynamics.
%   -- Articulations: mezzo-staccato, staccatissimo, portato.
%   -- Handling of generic ornaments (in lily, `\stopped'; in 
%		most early music:  ornament this note (trill, turn 
%		or mordent as the player wishes))
% * Automatic gruppetto at end of trill; better handling of 
%      initial/final grace notes on trill
% * Automatic ornaments.
%   * Spot cadences and ornament
%   * Look for quaver-dotted note for trills, for example.  
%   * Fill in steps. (Needs lookahead/lookbehind.)
% * `afterturn' -- a turn after the start of a note.
% * accidentals for trills and turns

% PARAMETERS
% How much to compress notes marked Staccato.  CPE Bach says `as short as 
% may conveniently be played, as if the keys were too hot to touch'.  
% Most modern sources say 1/2 the notated length of a note.
#(define ac:staccatoFactor '(1 . 2)) 

% And tenuto (if we ever implement time stealing, this should be >1.0)
#(define ac:tenutoFactor '(1 . 1))

% How much to articulate normal notes.  CPE Bach says 1/2 (and
